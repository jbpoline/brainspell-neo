In the next stage of development, we need to fully restore all of the features in the old Brainspell platform, and we need to implement features that will be useful for researchers conducting meta-analyses.

One feature that we need to restore from the old platform include the ability for users to add their own coordinates to an article. Currently, we only fetch the coordinates from Neurosynth, but users can't edit them. We also need to reimplement "collections," which are groups of studies that users can save for their own reference. When a user is logged in, we should show them whether they previously upvoted/downvoted a tag on an article.

Once the old platform's features are reimplemented, we can add in data such as z-effective scores and the number of participants for each study. We also hope to add data visualizations that can aid researchers in developing promising hypotheses. Ideally, we can have a small group of researchers try using Brainspell, and they can tell us what kinds of features they would find most useful.
