This purpose of this project is to create a platform to 1) facilitate the human-curation of neuroimaging literature and 2) provide tools for researchers to better perform meta-analyses.

In this section:

1. Why Brainspell? (Why does the platform exist?)
2. What were the problems that we wanted to solve? (architecture; difficulty with getting PHP developers)
3. A summary of the choices made.
